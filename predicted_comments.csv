men pmo ughhh,Good,Very Bad
you seem to think house management is somehow less taxing than a corporate job if youre the homemaker its a full time job even when you sit down to relax one of the kids will break something or start a fight with their sibling even if its a more relaxed theres no time truly off,Good,Abusive
never ever give up your financial independence as a woman,Neutral,Very Bad
im surprsed that people are still stuck with such expectations dont give in to these demands you will find people who will support your career choices i think there are plenty of people now who understand importance of career for women,Very Bad,Very Good
at least they are upfront about it and can be rejected quickly i have unfortunately seen multiple cases in my family where they were very accepting and supportive in the start but right after marriage they showed their true colors and created such toxic situations where the only option was to either leave the career or end the marriage and when kids are there it often becomes a no win situation for the woman who have no choice but to leave their career behind,Very Bad,Abusive
ahahaha thats so cool im really happy for you,Neutral,Abusive
i cook and clean every day,Very Bad,Very Bad
year old here with kinda conventional parents i dunno what kinda backwater dumbasses you got my apologies but in this economy my parents also advised that if she is comfortable with a job let her be better yet why not just let her do what she wants more money the better i know its a greedy look in the world but like whats the harm in a bit more cash flow i know providing is a great thing but a helping hand never hurts does it,Neutral,Very Good
yea they can if they want modern schooling makes that possible if somebody wants to argue that within the parameters of family life you can encourage women to be more worldly thats a perfectly plausible argument many people do this some hardliners and some feminists at the other end of the spectrum will say this is impossible though the important thing is prioritization none of those behaviours you mentioned are absent in women of nations with high flfp,Good,Very Good
because we are,Very Bad,Very Good
i didnt read all that but i will say one thing dont give up on your career because ppl in pakistan specially relatives and in laws loves you to be helpless and dependent on them and also to be a maid for the entire family and extended family to by giving up your careeer youre going to cut both of your hands,Good,Very Good
our society is sexually repressed porn has further worsen the problems most of people are hypocrites just see the average viral videos on facebook mostly seen by people so their inner guilt try to justify this by pointing fingers,Abusive,Very Bad
did i say to leave your job and where did i say men not being good dads i said you cant expect a man to stay at home or do less work than woman that is his fitrat and expect women to work and provide for family i said clearly if your are ambitious and focused on your career then there will be compromises you have to make when it comes to family this is a very generic perspective common in all faiths and background,Good,Abusive
hi first of all please dont give up your financial independence i think it does wonders to protect your selfesteem keep looking you will find someone worthy even if it takes some time secondly please beware of the nikame nikathu men ie men who want to solely rely on their wives income without working hard theyre the complete opposite of the men youre facing probably but men like that exist in my peripheral and they run their wives to the ground so please dont fall into any traps like that just because they dont have a problem with you working please thoroughly discuss the financial goals and distribution of chores etc with any prospects before making a decision i was lucky in finding a guy who shared my mindset of dual income and shared household responsibility youll find one too good luck,Bad,Very Good
so i have been thinking i understand that continuing to exist is a very base drive and always have been in form of the drive for progeny or propagation however the evolutionary branch that we are a part of large brains high encephalization quotient seems to come with some tradeoffs in that regard imo human beings tend to show some traits that dont directly lineup with continuing to exist because of this apparent tradeoff between encoded communal vs individual wellbeing in short the large brain do help us propagate better but it also results in the ability to just rather go for immediate personal wellbeing it sounds ridiculous but maybe that is the next evolutionary step the brain has to be dumbed down a bit for people to continue to want to propagate actively not through eugenics or something lol but evolutionarily,Good,Very Good
ending your career isnt even a religious requirement by any means this is purely cultural and not the good kind of cultural im all for marrying young but not until you find a decent partner your dad had the right idea mine also wanted me to be able to live independently entrust god with this matter and be confident this is the way to find what youre looking for,Bad,Abusive
thank you its frustrating when societal and cultural norms actively suppress half the populations potential,Bad,Very Bad
this is truly impressiveboth your ideas and your writing my mother and her sister started a school in karachi around and i sense a similar spirit in you you come across as very ambitious never lose that the right person will add to your life while the wrong one will take away,Good,Abusive
where are you getting these proposals from it is insane to think that so far every proposal youve received is following the same backwards mindset i think you should try flipping the script over and ask their son to be a full time househusband with the same promises of food and shelter i doubt many proposals compare the financial health you have accumulated as described in your post,Very Good,Abusive
mujhe apna personal assistant rkh low paying,Abusive,Very Good
i mean if you want to follow western feminism follow all of it no,Abusive,Very Good
dont settle for that mindset ever youve seen how it is to be independent you dont want to go back specially if someones demanding that of you plus assuming you quit can they even support your lifestyle,Bad,Abusive
simple they have a choice to chose you have a choice to chose you judge them for having their choice they judge you for having theirs no body is forcing anyone we are just a judgemental nation,Very Good,Very Good
find what youre good at and start making connections its not about the money its about being passionate as long as you have something to work towards you will earn,Neutral,Very Good
tbh thats how marriage has always worked only now times are changing and women are demanding more equal partnership but historically its always been in favor of men,Very Good,Very Bad
let me cut right to the chase sorry if this sounds offensive the core issue is male insecurity strictly biologically speaking males are stronger in physique than females but female sexual function is much much more powerful than male sexual system female libido is like a nuclear power reactor compared to males being a steam engine this incapacity of men to face upto this fact generate a societal drive to subjugate and dominate women it is an anathema to male ego to apprehend the power of female libido once we ascertain this fact it follows that men will try their best to keep women subservient taking women financial independence makes perfect sense since it preempts any risk of female exercising their own will in sexual matters is the worst fear and agency,Very Good,Very Good
tou aap kar lo ye noble kaam,Neutral,Abusive
its boring arguing with ai theres no substance fertiity decline is a complex phenomenon yes i agree thats why i think its too risky to disturb the status quo nobody really know the exact casualty and influence of the different factors that correlate with fertility decline yes its the womens choice where to utilize that potential so why are you upset with people who are looking for marriage which is for creating families that want a wife that expresses their potential towards the marriage draining come on now men have fought to the death for their ideologies you can argue against the things i casually express,Very Bad,Abusive
these guys will find someone like that too because women themselves are not fighting this either its all transactional which is sad because a lifelong partnership is meant to be much more doing things because you care for the other person and not out of expectations,Very Good,Abusive
oh please too dramatic just say no to those who want you to quit people can have their preferences,Very Good,Abusive
im not married but thats how things turn out to be your whole life will be bound to your kids and the house like a man can travel without the family even after getting married and can still enjoy life like a bachelor can a woman do that even if she doesshe will be called irresponsible and what not see i also earn and i worked extremely hard to get to where i am and i swear to you i will always choose this because in this case scenario if i was a man all i would have to do is earn which i am already doing if being a housewife was so amazingwhy do men want their daughters to be financially independent and independent in every way possible and to have a job because nobody respects housewives its like work that doesnt get appreciated or respected if it was so amazingno woman would have had the desire to be independent and not just stay home because its hard we know its hard men dont,Abusive,Very Good
im quite happy in this bubble yes we all know the world is shit i suggest everyone try to find one of these bubbles,Neutral,Very Good
they only do when youre not the wife and i was talking about the majority youre just lucky,Abusive,Abusive
awh thank you jazakallahu khair,Abusive,Good

unrelated question but what qualifies as an industry leading salary here,Neutral,Very Good
genuine question im currently unmarried who takes care of the baby or kids if both parents work i dont trust paid maids or daycares maids are fine for house chores and cleaning etc and even making food but i cant decide about the upbringing of the kids,Neutral,Abusive
point to ponder,Very Good,Abusive
thank you lt the problem is they cannot digest someone who isnt desperately financially dependent on them,Neutral,Abusive
thank you for sharing your perspective how can i call myself a man when my ability to take care of myself is reliant on another person i might be adding this to a book im working on men in pakistan have a lot of audacity claiming a womans career is disposable while their entire lives are funded by their fathers and their undies are still washed by their mothers,Good,Abusive
nooe nope dont do it you are young go outside of pk please lol you are so educated and deserve better you can get someone providing and also let you have freedom to work all women need their own savings and independence also these fams expect loads of kids and free labour and then deal with their drama for free more women are tuning out of that,Abusive,Abusive
please dont compromise the other route is extremely painful and lonely i was given the permission for job which meant all expenses for me baby and even that man i had to bear still i had to fully manage household and wherever i couldnt i was routinely shamed through taunts from him his immediate family and even extended they would like to reduce you to nothingness so they can still control you fully while enjoying the salary you bring you loose your sanity in the process,Abusive,Very Good
what job do u have at thats so high paying i need inspirations for careers,Very Good,Very Good
not all men but most men wish i had met you when i was your age,Very Good,Abusive
yeah you do make valid points here pakistan is frankly far behind the times and has been deeply infected with indian culture sorry you had to go through that op,Good,Abusive
during a rishta talking phase i had a guy ask me what specialty i was going to choose after i passed my fcps paper so i told him that i love emergency med so ill pick that not actually forensic med is what i will pursue but i tend to say em med just to see the guys response for the next half hour that guy tried to convince me that em med was bad by googling reasons and tried me to change my mind it was hilarious,Bad,Very Good
thank you so much for your kind words i truly appreciate it i worked so hard for this and im saving up to eventually move abroad inshaallah,Good,Abusive
maybe find someone on your level whos educated and openminded my best guess is that these men are intimidated and want control find someone who wont chain you to the customs and traditions of pakistani society i wasnt raised in pakistan so im not sure how bad things are there but girl to girl please stand your ground and dont accept any less than you deserve,Bad,Abusive
thats not a common thing in pakistan at all until maybe very recently traditionally it was basically christian marriage norms monogamy and no divorce nobody was divorcing their wife and not taking care of her thats unheard of but modern people are different which means less marriage because of the risk,Neutral,Very Good
cut them off and wear a thong,Very Bad,Abusive
gtyoure so funny why dont u become a comedian,Bad,Abusive

imagine this there are countless eligible bachelors who would kill for a spouse like you who are as open minded as you are who wants to have a wife who thinks on her own not a maid to do the mundane stuff trust me there are so many of them we see what we see because of our past experiences and conditioning you see that specific kind of potential partners because you are telling the universe what you dont want try to change the statement and ask the universe for the love you want and you shall receive i know this sounds very odd but thats how life is odd,Very Good,Abusive
thats a strange argument it doesnt even follow you can generate revenue from your inheritance also its not as if there is a direct command in the quran its deduced that they can keep the money they earn if there was a direct command you might have a case that it implies that but in fact the quran literally calls men qawwam and assumes women are financially dependent on them,Bad,Very Bad
ladies never ever quit your job for a man or even after having children always have your own bank account that your husband is not a beneficiary to nor does he know about financial freedom gives you a safety net nothing and nobody else will provide in this country or anywhere in the world having your own money allows you to leave toxic unhealthy and even abusive situations and never finance a mans life especially if youre muslim its his job to provide food housing and basic expenses you can enhance your married lives but dont fall for this western feminism of,Very Good,Abusive
the only sensible comment in here the amount of brainwash is too rampant yes men have suppressed women rights in pakistan since long but the current solution isnt the way to go about it the men went one extreme and now the women are going the other extreme of the spectrum western feminism liberalism god have mercy on us because pakistan is a country known for its extremism whether political social religious ideological gender gap or feminism its a funny country id say,Abusive,Very Good
exactly its the systemic lack of freedom that makes all the difference not just in careers but in daily life it makes the cost of independence impossibly high eventually leading to submission,Neutral,Very Good
i dont see how common misconception these days is independence badtameez larki this is a long and complicated discussion anyways marriages last if people compromise and learn to live with each other by avoiding each others disliks and focusing on shared goals i think shared goals and values is the real key to marital happiness,Neutral,Abusive
stay strong and dont give in but just be careful of people who are too willing to settle with you because of the financial success and support you can provide seen too many cases where a hard working wife is exploited not in the kitchen but out of their wealth by lazy unsuccessful men they end up miserable the other way around,Neutral,Very Good
our society also uses religion as a means of control and to guilt trip women into giving up everything theyve worked for because for them apparently the only honorable thing a muslim woman can do is get married and have kids,Bad,Abusive
well more power to you why do you have an issue with me trying to choose what i want to do when im supporting your decision to work its like arguing for the sake of arguing,Bad,Abusive
i have a very high paying career but i would like nothing more than to retire and run the house while my wife takes on the burden of being the bread winner the stress would be off me and i could have free time to pursue my hobbies youre just starting out and it prolly seems exciting for you to work well who knows the excitement might even last in my experience though it wears you down it seems youre just going on a rant of man hating im sure there are many men like me who would be ok with their wife taking the role of bread winner especially if she is earning a lot,Neutral,Very Good
i agree with financial independence but what would you do when kids come in place or neither husband or wife get time to see each other i am not telling you to quit job my mom is a great doctorbut either you can chase your ambitions to the fullest or tone yourself down and create space and time for your family because men will not do that it is just not his fitrat and balancing both worlds is not everyones cup of tea,Abusive,Abusive
gtthat care is often measured using the scale of sacrifice that hit hard never really thought about it i guess but its very true wishing you the best hope you find some one who understands how you want to live your life,Good,Very Good
yes its insane and tragically hilarious because a majority of those men were highly educated and successful we dont do rishtay wali stuff so most of them were just from relatives family friends and acquaintances i tried muzz though but thats a story for another day lol,Bad,Very Good
gtthis argument is a textbook example of benevolent sexism framing the removal of a womans autonomy as a gift of protection real protection doesnt require the total surrender of financial autonomy that is simply coercion calling protection coercion assumes that autonomy is the highest good and that all forms of dependence are inherently degrading that assumption is the ideological brainwashing i was talking about every stable society limits individual autonomy in exchange for order and mutual obligation marriage is one such institution if any reduction of autonomy is framed as oppression then marriage itself becomes incompatible with adulthood not just any traditional marriage gtyour traditional model is also a historical fallacy the sole male provider is a modern luxury whereas most women especially in the muslim world have always worked to ensure family survival promoting egalitarianism which prioritizes social equality and dignity for all is not a western misunderstanding but a proven economic strategy yes women have always worked but largely within family based economic units not as independents pursuing personal advancement detached from household prioritiesaka modern feminists this ideological brainwashing is not women just contributing it is women insisting that their individual careers must remain untouchable regardless of marital consequences and bringing egalitarian systems in the discussion especially concering a culture like pakistan is illogical excluding externalize costs lower birth rates weaker family cohesion higher divorce and atomized social structures economic output alone is not the only metric of a societys health gti have heard this script before dismissing a womans autonomy as a copout is just a defensive tactic to avoid admitting that true respect in a relationship requires a foundation of equality the disagreement here is not about dignity it is about whether marriage should prioritize individual autonomy or collective stability men like me or the men who have rejected you so far choose the latter openly and unapologetically you can reject this model if you want men are equally free to reject you too but stop pretending that your rejection is morally self evident rather than value driven,Abusive,Abusive
ill leave it here ps youre literally way too young to be thinking of marriage enjoy your life and independence until the right person comes along never compromise on your standards and values for insecure men like that,Very Bad,Abusive
