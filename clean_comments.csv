"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",thank you for these words the irony is that i am by nature deeply loving nurtured by a wonderful family so this desire to love isnt born of need but an ingrained capacity to care yet the bitter lesson of adulthood is accepting that marriage is seldom about the simple gift of romantic love and that care is often measured using the scale of sacrifice the bigger the sacrifice the more you supposedly care right pure clownery
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this?

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",tbh thats how marriage has always worked only now times are changing and women are demanding more equal partnership but historically its always been in favor of men
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",indeed i am a male mind you so i dont have your experiences still i will say that my multiyear stay in germany really opened my eyes to this we pakistanis think of freedom there as purely sexual but when you observe their societies you see the casual ease with which they navigate their careers or even just public transport a german bus has little girls going alone to school young people going to work or recreation and old grandmas out for a stroll our society imprisons women either by custom or the sheer threat of violence and abuse that hangs over them should they take the wrong route or like you said family pressures
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",exactly its the systemic lack of freedom that makes all the difference not just in careers but in daily life it makes the cost of independence impossibly high eventually leading to submission
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",yeah the whole sexual thing pk is all about it they just point fingers at countries which are better in so many ways
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",our society is sexually repressed porn has further worsen the problems most of people are hypocrites just see the average viral videos on facebook mostly seen by 40 people so their inner guilt try to justify this by pointing fingers
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",whats strange is that in countries like germany this isnt even a talking point and yet these societies function perfectly well its a cultural issue from what i can see because as i understand it there is nothing in islam that forbids a woman having a career
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",islam teaches that women can keep the money they earn which is a pointless command unless they can generate independent revenue
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",not pointless if she can work though
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",thats what i am saying the whole idea that women have to stay solely focused on domestic chores is a modern middleclass delusion not supported by any religious teaching
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",yep we agree high five
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",solely focused no primarily focused is obviously encouraged by religion the only modern thing about it is that modern housework actually leaves enough time for other pursuits because of technology this wasnt the case before when fatima ra was complaining about the pain in her hands from grinding flour it took hours out of your day and the prophet saws didnt tell ali to help her with it
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",thats a strange argument it doesnt even follow you can generate revenue from your inheritance also its not as if there is a direct command in the quran its deduced that they can keep the money they earn if there was a direct command you might have a case that it implies that but in fact the quran literally calls men qawwam and assumes women are financially dependent on them
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",in germany both contribute germany also has an advanced economy with many white collar jobs unlike pakistan they can also import many turks and other immigrants to supplement their low fertility they also got rich and created lasting institutions first then they got feminism they would be more prosperous even with 0 flfp nothing in islam forbids it but as feminists convincingly argue there are many that things at the very least dont complement egalitarianism and most likely hurt it
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this?

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",100 agree with you even those who let their wives work after marriage expect them to handle all household chores and take care of the kids after coming home from work while they either lounge around watching tv scroll through reels or go out with friends
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",exactly the permission to work is often just a mandate for a second unpaid shift

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",its a big threat to the overall patriarchal system of pakistan which is only being perpetuated in this economic and political crisis instead of getting better like most nations have done for example the whole crisis of pakistani doctor brides is genuinely so embarrassing both the men and older women tend to hate on younger pakistani women who are breaking from these traumatizing molds the men feel emboldened and worthy having someone obey them and aunties feel better too because then they dont have to deal with the existential realization that they too could have pursued their dreams instead of becoming miserable while tending to the expectation of sacrifice but im proud of you for not giving into the guilt and shame manipulation culture to me this is real care for our society and betterment of our culture youre contributing to positive change that is much larger than the individual or household i have no doubt that with time youll find a man who isnt intimidated by you and celebrates your success

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",nooe nope dont do it you are young go outside of pk please lol you are so educated and deserve better you can get someone providing and also let you have freedom to work all women need their own savings and independence also these fams expect loads of kids and free labour and then deal with their drama for free more women are tuning out of that
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this?

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",genuinely curious when talking about gender equality how does finding someone providing i assume you mean financially help isnt that where the problem starts
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",no because men should be providing and have those traits in pk women are left at the mercy of their husbands and a lot work very less or not at all yet can push for kids and a slave at home
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",so thats the should for men whats the should for women
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",most women already do their fair share and more both should know life skills like cooking cleaning banking etc but women also have kids and unfairly do most of the child rearing should be fairer
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",i understand what youre saying but i think when you have the expectation that someone should provide it automatically brings them in a position to exert control its not how it should be in an ideal world but i think this social expectation does contribute to the problem op highlighted
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",all very valid points this is one of the things that keep the country lagging behind in terms of prosperity when it comes to bigpicture its also the reason why people find it easier to move abroad and find partners outside of nationality and sometimes even religion in order of break free of these mindsets and patriarchy that being said its not always greener on the other side _just different textures_ stay your route op respect yourself
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this?

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",please dont compromise the other route is extremely painful and lonely i was given the permission for job which meant all expenses for me baby and even that man i had to bear still i had to fully manage household and wherever i couldnt i was routinely shamed through taunts from him his immediate family and even extended they would like to reduce you to nothingness so they can still control you fully while enjoying the salary you bring you loose your sanity in the process
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",it shows that they only weaponise islam for their patriarchal benefit because this is so unislamic giving your wife permission to work doesnt mean you have the right to her salary a baby is the mans expense to bear as well as all other household needs

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",maybe find someone on your level whos educated and openminded my best guess is that these men are intimidated and want control find someone who wont chain you to the customs and traditions of pakistani society i wasnt raised in pakistan so im not sure how bad things are there but girl to girl please stand your ground and dont accept any less than you deserve

(148th on GGI for a reason)",why financial independence why not financial contribution could convince more families if they saw that extra income i read this feminist named alice evans who discusses the reason that women in east asia now have high flfp is that the honour income tradeoff is worth it for families
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",your distinction between financial independence and financial contribution is a semantic trap that attempts to define a womans salary solely by its benefit to the household not by her own autonomy let me break it down for you financial independence the goal this ensures a woman has economic agency and exit options the most reliable deterrent against abuse and control financial contribution the benefit while increased household income is a positive externality the honour income tradeoff it must not be the primary justification for a womans labor reducing a womans career to only extra income or extra labour reinforces the patriarchal mindset that her work is secondary and dispensable my post is about equity of choice not justifying employment based on necessity or family benefit
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",yes i believe in the family men make money so they can provide for their families feminists argue women should make money too for whatever reasons if you want to convince people in a family centric society like pakistan you arent going to get anywhere by arguing i want to make money just in case i want to leave you contrary to popular belief people do believe that women are adult humans so they expect them to contribute to the family in some way thats why any reasonable feminist would just argue that both people should contribute to the economic life of the family and the domestic
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",you said women are adult humans exactly adult humans regardless of gender should have financial autonomy and equal say in their lives careers and household economy this is what economic contribution ensures financial contribution is about equal autonomy and value not just utility for the family
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this?

(148th on GGI for a reason)",true thats because its not her role but that gives families even more reason to ask them to leave their career its literally just a hobby at that point can you imagine evaluating a man for marriage and he insists on a hobby that will most likely make him a worst husband and father less time with wife and kids and make him more likely to divorce too

(148th on GGI for a reason)",where are you getting these proposals from it is insane to think that so far every proposal youve received is following the same backwards mindset i think you should try flipping the script over and ask their son to be a full time househusband with the same promises of food and shelter i doubt many proposals compare the financial health you have accumulated as described in your post
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this?

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this?

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",unfortunately this is a bad situation working women face they are either asked to quit their jobs or worse the man abandons all financial responsibility and the woman has to raise him too tbh id suggest you move out of the country pakistani men have a very outdated mindset and they have been taught that they are somehow superior to women and it gives them the right to exploit them
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",i agree with that i have also observed that 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants having grown up abroad expect women raised in pakistan to readily accept traditional selfsacrificing roles its an attempt to import the benefits of pakistani patriarchy into their liberated lives an attempt to harvest the fruit of patriarchy without having to live under its constraints themselves
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",i think it would be better to marry someone who you have an understanding with and know marrying someone random is a massive risk bec even if 1 out of 10 tells you they dont mind you working it doesnt guarantee that they wont later ask you to stop so its better to marry a friend or someone you know i know our current pakistani society and situation sucks but trust me theres a lot of people who are different from these people my sisters husband is one of those alhumdullilah and even my mom never raised me with the current bad traditions and concepts even my friends actively support their girls with their businesses ive seen both types of pakistanis and even if majority are stuck in old traditions and bad concepts theres quite a lot of good ones out there dw and leave it upto allah he has a plan heres my favourite line as a bonus jo mila wo behtar jo na mila usmein behtari good luck 3

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this?

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",gthe should be able to give her the exact amount of money that her job pays her without questioning what she does with it no that is hypocrisy because its not about the money women say they want to be able to pursue their careers not because of money but because of their own will because they want to do it regardless if it pays 10k or 100000k they say money doesnt matter what matters is that they are given their rights so have your rights and make as much as you want dont want to take care of the house no worries the husband doesnt have to either nobody should take care of the house because you cant force anyone a man is responsible for only providing the woman with her necessities not the luxuries but husbands go above and beyond necessities for their wives and provide them a life of comfort maybe not in your country

(148th on GGI for a reason)",let me cut right to the chase sorry if this sounds offensive the core issue is male insecurity strictly biologically speaking males are stronger in physique than females but female sexual function is much much more powerful than male sexual system female libido is like a nuclear power reactor compared to males being a steam engine this incapacity of men to face upto this fact generate a societal drive to subjugate and dominate women it is an anathema to male ego to apprehend the power of female libido once we ascertain this fact it follows that men will try their best to keep women subservient taking women financial independence makes perfect sense since it preempts any risk of female exercising their own will in sexual matters is the worst fear and agency

(148th on GGI for a reason)",im also pakistani american and i would say that ive encountered many guys here who are open to marrying someone who works i would hope some akalmand men in pakistan would feel the same way dont settle and give up your work its always great to see pakistanis excel in what they do i feel like some pakistanis are shortsighted and live in a society that has not seen growth they live by ideals and thoughts of honor yes im muslim but these values seem to be more cultural to me a lot of these men need to stop being so prideful if my wife has a great job and is an intelligent person i think it would be wonderful to see her be great in her field we can both work make a living in which we can truly support ourselves each other and our family members we can share taking care of the children and doing chores around the house and cooking because how can i call myself a man when my ability to take care of myself is reliant on another person ive lived by myself long enough to understand the importance of knowing how to do these things here in the us we dont exactly have safety nets especially if you dont have a bunch of extended relatives here i dont you have to survive and financial independence and your skills and your résumé become very important regardless of gender even our healthcare system can cost a lot and employer based insurance is a common way it becomes somewhat affordable ive visited some of the less privileged parts of pakistan its not all sunshine and rainbows there at all im sure if the men and women were more educated and were skilled workers there would be more factors changing pakistan for the better while making the lives of those families better

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",of course i dont mean to talk down to anyone circumstances can be tough as opportunities for work and upwards mobility are tough especially in pakistan i think that men and women need to communicate with each other and appreciate one another if i were at home id probably want to help my parents around more at least i just feel like its wrong to take anyone for granted women tend to get more of the short end of the stick in pakistan when it would be great for pakistan to actually empower them more

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",mashaallah im really happy for her and thank you for the kind words lt3
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",i didnt read the whole thing but i got the gist my advice is to never quit your job if youre earning well at this age imagine how much better youll earn in 10 years secondly youre only 23 focus on your career and forget about marriage for at least five or six years for all those people saying job chor do gi just cant accept number 1 a working woman and number 2 earning more than him people start saying biw ki kamaye and this type of shit only get married when you see someone compatible and earning as good as you because mindset ka farq aa jata ha and lastly never ever abandon your career even your job is not permanent but shadi k bad job chordo gi sey na bani to dono cheizy gaye at least you will be independent achay loog bhi ha wait for the right one

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",hi first of all please dont give up your financial independence i think it does wonders to protect your selfesteem keep looking you will find someone worthy even if it takes some time secondly please beware of the nikame nikathu men ie men who want to solely rely on their wives income without working hard theyre the complete opposite of the men youre facing probably but men like that exist in my peripheral and they run their wives to the ground so please dont fall into any traps like that just because they dont have a problem with you working please thoroughly discuss the financial goals and distribution of chores etc with any prospects before making a decision i was lucky in finding a guy who shared my mindset of dual income and shared household responsibility youll find one too good luck
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",a lot of these men hold archaic views that women should fall under patriarchs thumb and they dont want to have an equal partner who can live her own life outside playing traditional roles of a wife or mother they prefer someone who can be a proxy for their mother who can do chores for them but with the label of a wife with whom they can have sexual relationship with theyd rather prefer you to suffer than have an autonomy and agency of your own they romance on your zalalat so they can be the heros wholl rescue you by marriage if you are secure in yourself as an individual it means most men wont be up to your standards and they would have to actually make an effort to standout instead of hinging on womens desperation due to lack of financial freedom and her whole worth being diminished into getting transplanted from one house to another in desi culture youre young and society will shame or worse if you dont cave in but hold your ground and have faith in allah yes compromises are made during marriage but not at the cost of your dignity and principles a serious man wont prefer you to be subjugated to be with him and accept you as who you are instead of molding you into one you arent someones project to be worked on dont undervalue yourself
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",this hits the nail on the head its exactly why they find a woman with her own career and agency so threatening because you cant rescue someone who isnt desperate when a woman is financially and emotionally secure marriage becomes a choice between equals rather than a survival tactic and thats a reality many of these men just arent prepared to handle
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",ive heard some cases where the man says hes okay with having a job but after marriage he forces her to quit id say dont trust anyone and looking for rishtas is not the only way to find a partner there are sports clubs book clubs and so many things where maybe you can just find the right person
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",please never compromise on this you are only 23 incredibly accomplished and very clear about your values thats a strength not a flaw the right partner will see your career as part of who you are not something to erase for his comfort marriage should be a partnership built on respect autonomy and security not control disguised as tradition if that kind of man doesnt come along its still far better to remain independent than to shrink yourself to fit someone elses insecurity dont settle for anyone who asks you to give up your freedom dignity or future you deserve better and you will find it
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",maybe look for someone outside of pakistan could still be a pakistani just with a more open mindset
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",ending your career isnt even a religious requirement by any means this is purely cultural and not the good kind of cultural im all for marrying young but not until you find a decent partner your dad had the right idea mine also wanted me to be able to live independently entrust god with this matter and be confident this is the way to find what youre looking for
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",advice from a male whoever you are choosing eventually communicate to them clearly before that these are my nonnegotiable and i cant compromise on them i have seen plenty of people to not communicate before hoping other party will understand eventually which creates issues later i live abroad here you cant even survive decently without both parties working and i am looking for someone who is focused on their career as well but my friends in pakistan wanted house wives so they married accordingly there are women who just want to be house wives and there is nothing wrong with that just communicate before going into any relationship and dont compromise on the life you have imagined for yourself good luck
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",pakistan is highly patriarchal and uses religion to push women further into submission the same bozos that say islam tells women to stay at home and be just homemakers and mothers will also never pray a day in their life or read the quran unfortunately this antiwomen attitude isnt going away since it permeates most islamic societies possibly only turkey is enlightened than the likes of pakistan etc when it comes to a womans role in society

(148th on GGI for a reason)",me and my family have spent half our lives in pakistan and half in afghanistan my nom was married when she was 17 and never received education as was the norm in the villages back then my father was the first man from his tiny village who passed entrance exam and went to public university back then in kabul after that till today whatever happened in their lives whatever every mouth had to say in every city they had been my father had only one ambition his children especially the daughters will study and so they did my father still doesnt have his own house till date because he spent all his income on our education after the graduation of my sisters they both worked and when proposals would come my dad would reject them whenever there was a mention of quitting job he used to say why should i throw them in a hell just because they will get old in their fathers home i will take care of them until i have blood in my body my sisters are now married and living their own lives still continuing their careers though my oldest sister has been considering leaving her job now as she wants to better care for her young children she says that just raising children and raising them with love and care are bit different my dad still wishes for her to do her phd but its her and her husbands choice and shes happy somoral of this story the same as many other comments here are suggesting dont give into these demands just for the sake of marrying itself a good partner will come by working after marriage or not that cant be predicted because life but most important part is you marry knowing its your choice and no one will force their decisions on you

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",any proposal demanding changes to your career is abuse and a huge red flag if this is what it is like before marriage then it will not get any better after marriage only worse it appears that so far all your proposals are from insecure men that i would not even regard as a man they are embarrassment to men most probably the are also weak and still boys with financial security you can hire cleaners cooks etc so most of the arguments are redundant other than to control you if your job is remote then you could in the future of course and if its your choice do your family planningchildcareetc around this so its a winwin stay strong and you will find your path and the right man inshallah

(148th on GGI for a reason)",its boring arguing with ai theres no substance fertiity decline is a complex phenomenon yes i agree thats why i think its too risky to disturb the status quo nobody really know the exact casualty and influence of the different factors that correlate with fertility decline yes its the womens choice where to utilize that potential so why are you upset with people who are looking for marriage which is for creating families that want a wife that expresses their potential towards the marriage draining come on now men have fought to the death for their ideologies you can argue against the things i casually express

(148th on GGI for a reason)",it really is not difficult to balance work family pakistani society paints them to be incompatible because it saves the status quo when we look to the time of islams birth we find incredible women who balanced exemplary leadership both in their families and in their work hazrat khadija for one alshifa bint abdullah rufaida alaslamia etc a society that prioritizes family is one that prioritizes the welfare empowerment and betterment of all of its members where everyone supports one another grow be kind people and live a life of meaning positive impact even for the kids its important to have happy driven parents they can look up to rather than ammi spending all day in the kitchen as a certificate of being a good mother if a woman doesnt want to work thats perfectly fine too but no one should be telling anyone to shrink their world when they dont have to
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",yeah or even go to some poor village in pakistan today peasant women dont have the luxury of staying and home and doing nothing economically beneficial thats a middleclass delusion the vast majority of muslim women throughout history had to work to survive
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",yes women peasants in subsistence living had to work to survive in some regions the nobility would even put pregnant women to work but this depends on a lot of factors plough dominated agriculture was mostly men because of how physically demanding it was some even say that patriarchy is stronger in those areas women would have different work to do and also housework was genuinely time consuming making clothing converting raw ingredients into food washing clothes manually etc and you also needed to produce many children because of child mortality and the usefulness of extra labour there were undoubtedly adjustments made to accommodate that but what does that have to do with anything this is an english speaking subreddit on a post about a high earning professional basically aristocratic in terms of relative wealth and aristocratic women didnt work we dont live in that brutal malthusian world anymore not even the illiterate peasants of pakistan live in that world and peasant women were completely dependent on their families the only law enforcement was the patriarch their toil was to survive not for an exit plan they did unpaid labour they still produced the majority of the humans that exist today something which industrial economies where women dont have to work cant

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",i dont think so it is definitely difficult with a large family not everybody is amy coney barrett even with a small family it is difficult this very post has people complaining about the second shift we dont really know exactly how they balanced those things they might have been exceptional i dont think we know much about the work khadija did after marriage if it is so easy why do we have a global fertility crisis cant look up to ammi if you dont even exist if it is possible to balance these things go right ahead you can even outsource all the work family life requires if you want but we all know it means delayed children and smaller families
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",id sm rather see slightly smaller pakistani families that are financially emotionally stable then the poverty literacy amp morality crisis amongst millions upon millions of pakistani families today i dont think of children success of family and anyways pakistan is the 5th most populated countries in the world so the pakistani population will always only be going up the kids are at school during the day what is wrong if the mom being at work during then ammi can be in the kitchen with the kids in the morning amp evening amp weekends so presently are you then saying that kids dont look up to their fathers since baba is at work he doesnt exist i see a lot of housewife pakistani women who feel so miserableunhappy with life and from that get drawn into petty things that fall into sin backbiting judging gossiping nosiness ungratefulness etc which isnt good for the kids or husband or society either i believe we are meant for much more than that amp our women become like that due to our society limiting them in creating a life outside their family again to each their own and not every person can balance both being a parent working we see a lot of nonpresent dads too but for those that can its wrong to downplay their abilities
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",yea they can if they want modern schooling makes that possible if somebody wants to argue that within the parameters of family life you can encourage women to be more worldly thats a perfectly plausible argument many people do this some hardliners and some feminists at the other end of the spectrum will say this is impossible though the important thing is prioritization none of those behaviours you mentioned are absent in women of nations with high flfp

(148th on GGI for a reason)",so i have been thinking i understand that continuing to exist is a very base drive and always have been in form of the drive for progeny or propagation however the evolutionary branch that we are a part of large brains high encephalization quotient seems to come with some tradeoffs in that regard imo human beings tend to show some traits that dont directly lineup with continuing to exist because of this apparent tradeoff between encoded communal vs individual wellbeing in short the large brain do help us propagate better but it also results in the ability to just rather go for immediate personal wellbeing it sounds ridiculous but maybe that is the next evolutionary step the brain has to be dumbed down a bit for people to continue to want to propagate actively not through eugenics or something lol but evolutionarily
