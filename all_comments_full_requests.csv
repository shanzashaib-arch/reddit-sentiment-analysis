(148th on GGI for a reason)","Easy for me to say, but… Don’t. Don’t give in. Accept the fact that this noise will be ever-present (and that it is indeed just noise), and continue to craft the life you want to live. If you find a partner willing to share a life with you on your conditions, great! If not, c’est la vie.

If you wish to discuss more, DMs are open."

The irony is that I am, by nature, deeply loving, nurtured by a wonderful family, so this desire to love isn't born of need, but an ingrained capacity to care. Yet, the bitter lesson of adulthood is accepting that marriage is seldom about the simple gift of romantic love, and that care is often measured using the scale of sacrifice. The bigger the sacrifice, the more you supposedly care, right? Pure clownery."

Still, I will say that my multiyear stay in Germany really opened my eyes to this. We Pakistanis think of freedom there as purely sexual but when you observe their societies, you see the casual ease with which they navigate their careers or even just public transport. A German bus has little girls going alone to school, young people going to work or recreation and old grandmas out for a stroll

Our society *imprisons* women either by custom or the sheer threat of violence and abuse that hangs over them should they take the wrong route or like you said family pressures"

It's a cultural issue from what I can see because as I understand it, there is nothing in islam that forbids a woman having a career."

The whole idea that women have to stay solely focused on domestic chores is a modern middle-class delusion not supported by any religious teaching

The only modern thing about it is that modern housework actually leaves enough time for other pursuits because of technology. This wasn't the case before. When Fatima RA was complaining about the pain in her hands from grinding flour it took hours out of your day. And the Prophet SAWS didn't tell Ali to help her with it"

Also, it's not as if there is a direct command in the Quran. It's deduced that they can keep the money they earn. If there was a direct command you might have a case that it implies that but in fact the Quran literally calls men qawwam and assumes women are financially dependent on them"

Germany also has an advanced economy with many white collar jobs (unlike Pakistan). They can also import many Turks and other immigrants to supplement their low fertility. They also got rich and created lasting institutions first. Then they got feminism. They would be more prosperous even with 0 FLFP 

Nothing in Islam forbids it. But as feminists convincingly argue, there are many that things at the very least don't complement egalitarianism and most likely hurt it."

(148th on GGI for a reason)","It's a big threat to the overall patriarchal system of Pakistan, which is only being perpetuated in this economic and political crisis instead of getting better like most nations have done. For example, the whole crisis of Pakistani ""doctor brides"" is genuinely so embarrassing.

Both the men and older women tend to hate on younger Pakistani women who are breaking from these traumatizing molds. The men feel emboldened and worthy having someone obey them, and aunties feel better too because then they dont have to deal with the existential realization that they too, could have pursued their dreams instead of becoming miserable while tending to the expectation of ""sacrifice"".

But I'm proud of you for not giving into the guilt and shame manipulation culture! To me this is real care for our society and betterment of our culture - you're contributing to positive change that is much larger than the individual or household. I have no doubt that with time, you'll find a man who isn't intimidated by you and celebrates your success :)"

You can get someone providing and also let you have freedom to work. ALL women need their own savings and independence. Also these fams expect loads of kids and free labour and then deal with their drama for free. More women are tuning out of that.

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this?

In PK women are left at the mercy of their husbands and a lot work very less or not at all yet can push for kids and a slave at home.

(148th on GGI for a reason)","I understand what you're saying but i think when you have the expectation that someone should provide, it automatically brings them in a position to exert control.

It's also the reason why people find it easier to move abroad and find partners outside of nationality and sometimes even religion in order of break free of these mindsets and patriarchy. 

That being said, its not always greener on the other side - _just different textures._

Stay your route OP. Respect yourself. 💙"

Why not financial contribution? Could convince more families if they saw that extra income. 

I read this feminist named Alice Evans who discusses the reason that women in East Asia now have high FLFP is that the honour income tradeoff is worth it for families."
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","Your distinction between financial independence and financial contribution is a semantic trap that attempts to define a woman's salary solely by its benefit to the household, not by her own autonomy.

Let me break it down for you :) 

Financial Independence (The Goal): This ensures a woman has economic agency and exit options - the most reliable deterrent against abuse and control.

Financial Contribution (The Benefit): While increased household income is a positive externality (the ""honour income tradeoff""), it must not be the primary justification for a woman's labor. Reducing a woman’s career to only ""extra income"" or ""extra labour"" reinforces the patriarchal mindset that her work is secondary and dispensable. My post is about equity of choice, not justifying employment based on necessity or family benefit."
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","Yes, I believe in the family. Men make money so they can provide for their families. Feminists argue women should make money too for whatever reasons. If you want to convince people in a family centric society like Pakistan you aren't going to get anywhere by arguing ""I want to make money just in case I want to leave you"". Contrary to popular belief, people do believe that women are adult humans so they expect them to contribute to the family in some way. That's why any reasonable feminist would just argue that both people should contribute to the economic life of the family (and the domestic)."
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","You said women are adult humans. Exactly. Adult humans, regardless of gender, should have financial autonomy and equal say in their lives, careers, and household economy. This is what economic contribution ensures. Financial contribution is about equal autonomy and value, not just utility for the family."
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","No, that's not true. The family imposes restrictions on all adult humans.

But that gives families even more reason to ask them to leave their career. It's literally just a hobby at that point. Can you imagine evaluating a man for marriage and he insists on a hobby that will most likely make him a worst husband and father (less time with wife and kids) and make him more likely to divorce too?"

Common misconception these days is ""independence = badtameez larki"". This is a long and complicated discussion anyways.

They cry about attracting gold diggers but the fact is they cannot deal with a woman who is not financially dependent on them.

No. That is hypocrisy because it's not about the money. Women say they want to be able to pursue their careers not because of money, but because of their own will, because they want to do it, regardless if it pays 10k or 100,000k. They say money doesn't matter, what matters is that they are given their rights. So have your rights and make as much as you want. Don't want to take care of the house? No worries, the husband doesn't have to either. Nobody should take care of the house because you can't force anyone 🤭

A man is responsible for only providing the woman with her necessities, not the luxuries. But husbands go above and beyond necessities for their wives and provide them a life of comfort. Maybe not in your country."

The core issue is Male insecurity. 
Strictly Biologically speaking: males are stronger in physique than females. BUT female sexual function is much much more powerful than male sexual system. Female libido is like a nuclear power reactor compared to male’s being a steam engine. This incapacity of men to face upto this fact generate a societal drive to subjugate and dominate women.  It is an anathema to male ego to apprehend the power of female libido. Once we ascertain this fact, it follows that men will try their best to keep women subservient. Taking women financial independence makes perfect sense since it preempts any “risk” of female exercising their own will (in sexual matters is the worst fear) and agency. "

I would hope some akalmand men in Pakistan would feel the same way. Don’t settle and give up your work. It’s always great to see Pakistanis excel in what they do! 

I feel like some Pakistanis are shortsighted and live in a society that has not seen growth. They live by ideals and thoughts of honor. Yes, I’m Muslim, but these values seem to be more cultural to me. A lot of these men need to stop being so prideful. If my wife has a great job and is an intelligent person, I think it would be wonderful to see her be great in her field. We can both work, make a living in which we can truly support ourselves, each other, and our family members. We can share taking care of the children and doing chores around the house and cooking, because how can I call myself a man when my ability to take care of myself is reliant on another person? I’ve lived by myself long enough to understand the importance of knowing how to do these things. 

Here in the US, we don’t exactly have safety nets, especially if you don’t have a bunch of extended relatives here. I don’t. You have to survive, and financial independence and your skills and your résumé become very important regardless of gender. Even our healthcare system can cost a lot, and employer based insurance is a common way it becomes somewhat affordable. I’ve visited some of the less privileged parts of Pakistan. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows there at all. I’m sure if the men and women were more educated and were skilled workers, there would be more factors changing Pakistan for the better while making the lives of those families better."

Imagine how much better you’ll earn in 10 years.  Secondly, you’re only 23. Focus on your career and forget about marriage for at least five or six years.

For all those people saying job chor do gi just cant accept number 1 a working woman and number 2 earning more than him. 

People start saying biw ki kamaye and this type of shit. 
Only get married when you see someone compatible and earning as good as you because mindset ka farq aa jata ha. 

And lastly never ever abandon your career. 
Even your job is not permanent but shadi k bad job chordo gi sey na bani to dono cheizy gaye. At least you will be independent 
Achay loog bhi ha wait for the right one."

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","Hi! First of all, please don't give up your financial independence. I think it does wonders to protect your self-esteem. Keep looking, you will find someone worthy (even if it takes some time). 

Secondly, please beware of the *nikame, nikathu* men i.e., men who want to solely rely on their wives' income without working hard. They're the complete opposite of the men you're facing probably, but men like that exist in my peripheral and they run their wives to the ground. So, please, don't fall into any traps like that just because they don't have a problem with you working. Please thoroughly discuss the financial goals and distribution of chores, etc. with any prospects before making a decision. I was lucky in finding a guy who shared my mindset of dual income and shared household responsibility, you'll find one too. Good Luck!"
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","A lot of these men hold archaic views that women should fall under patriarch's thumb and they don't want to have an equal partner, who can live her own life outside playing traditional roles of a wife or mother. They prefer someone who can be a proxy for their mother, who can do chores for them, but with the label of a wife, with whom they can have sexual relationship with.

They'd rather prefer you to suffer than have an autonomy and agency of your own. They romance on your zalalat so they can be the heros who'll rescue you by marriage. 

If you are secure in yourself as an individual, it means most men won't be up to ***your*** standards and they would have to actually make an effort to standout, instead of hinging on women's desperation due to lack of financial freedom and her whole worth being diminished into getting transplanted from one house to another in Desi culture.

You're young and society will shame or worse if you don't cave in. But hold your ground and have faith in Allah. Yes, compromises are made during marriage but not at the cost of your dignity and principles. A serious man won't prefer you to be subjugated to be with him, and accept you as who you are instead of molding you into one.

You aren't someone's project to be worked on. Don't undervalue yourself!"
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","This hits the nail on the head. It’s exactly why they find a woman with her own career and agency so threatening, because you can’t 'rescue' someone who isn't desperate. When a woman is financially and emotionally secure, marriage becomes a choice between equals rather than a survival tactic, and that's a reality many of these men just aren't prepared to handle"

The right partner will see your career as part of who you are, not something to erase for his comfort.

Marriage should be a partnership built on respect, autonomy, and security not control disguised as tradition. If that kind of man doesn’t come along, it’s still far better to remain independent than to shrink yourself to fit someone else’s insecurity.

Don’t settle for anyone who asks you to give up your freedom, dignity, or future. You deserve better and you will find it."

(148th on GGI for a reason)",Advice from a male - whoever you are choosing eventually communicate to them clearly before that these are my nonnegotiable and I can’t compromise on them. I have seen plenty of people to not communicate before hoping other party will understand eventually which creates issues later. I live abroad here you can’t even survive decently without both parties working and I am looking for someone who is focused on their career as well. But my friends in Pakistan wanted house wives so they married accordingly. There are women who just want to be house wives and there is nothing wrong with that. Just communicate before going into any relationship and don’t compromise on the life you have imagined for yourself. Good luck.
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",Pakistan is highly patriarchal and uses religion to push women further into submission. The same bozos that say Islam tells women to stay at home and be just homemakers and mothers will also never pray a day in their life or read the Qu'ran. Unfortunately this anti-women attitude isn't going away since it permeates most Islamic societies. Possibly only Turkey is enlightened than the likes of Pakistan etc. when it comes to a woman's role in society.

I could go outside at midnight, and no one would bat an eye. In fact, men in my neighborhood would let me know that they were walking behind me and walk me to my apartment.  
  
Religion is nothing but a mere convenient device for controlling women here. Yahan aurat ke parde se deen shuru hota hai aur biwiyon ke faraiz par khatam ho jata hai. A woman dancing in a wedding is met with remarks like ""wh\*re"" and ""beghairat,"" while the men are excused because ""they're just having a great time."" Women are deemed as symbols of their ""honor"" and ""pride."" The same ""honor"" gets shot in her chest in front of hundreds because she expressed that she wanted to marry the man she wanted. In this society, a woman’s worth is measured by the magnitude of her sacrifice—how much and how long she survives the abuse. Only to get the title of an ""innocent mother"" from her very own son.  
  
Why do we need to even sacrifice anything? For what? Roti, kapra, aur ghar ki chat. Wo to shadi se pehle bhi mil raha hai, to shadi karne ki zaroorat kya hai aise mardon se? Your autonomy makes them insecure; nothing more than that."

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","Me and my family have spent half our lives in Pakistan and half in Afghanistan.
My nom was married when she was 17 and never received education (as was the norm in the villages back then). My father was the first man from his tiny village who passed entrance exam and went to public university back then (in Kabul). 
After that till today, whatever happened in their lives, whatever every mouth had to say in every city they had been, my father had only one ambition. His children, especially the daughters will study. 
And so they did. 
My father still doesnt have his own house till date, because he spent all his income on our education. After the graduation of my sisters, they both worked. 
And when proposals would come, my dad would reject them whenever there was a mention of quitting job. He used to say, ""why should I throw them in a hell just because 'they will get old in their father's home'? I will take care of them until I have blood in my body.""

My sisters are now married and living their own lives. Still continuing their careers. Though my oldest sister has been considering leaving her job now as she wants to better care for her young children. She says that just raising children and raising them with love and care are bit different. My dad still wishes for her to do her PHD, but its her and her husband's choice. And she's happy. 


So...moral of this story? The same as many other comments here are suggesting. Don't give into these demands just for the sake of marrying itself. A good partner will come by. 
Working after marriage or not, that can't be predicted because ...life. 
But most important part is, you marry knowing its your choice and no one will force their decisions on you."

(148th on GGI for a reason)","Your instincts are 100% correct, and I wish you the best. I think you shouldn't change your attitude.  Marriage should be a partnership whose roles are not dictated by gender roles but by love, friendship, and mutual admiration for each person's contributions.  Most men will catch up eventually, or it will go darker and more controlling like Iran and Afghanistan.   If it ever goes that direction, your workplace skills will be the only thing that allows you to leave the country and stay safe.  Your living example will do more to free women from these expectations than any NGO."

If this is what it is like BEFORE marriage then it will not get any better AFTER marriage, only WORSE.

It appears that so far all your proposals are from insecure men that I would not even regard as a man - they are embarrassment to men. Most probably the are also weak and still boys.

With financial security, you can hire cleaners, cooks, etc. so most of the arguments are redundant other than to CONTROL you. 

If your job is remote then you could, in the future of course AND if it’s your choice, do your family planning/childcare/etc. around this so it’s a win-win.

As we are pretty close, she is like my elder sister and when i tell you, she is soo happy with him. The deciding factor for her was that he didn’t make life a competition like the others, she gave me insides that some guys said NO cuz she was making more money then them. Lol

YES! And not to mention, your partner can never get even close to loving you as much as your parents, your partner can cut you off any time to gain the upper hand


Also if anyone wants to see the gender gap index in practice, know that the female population of the country is about 45-48%, and then go out into the streets, go literally anywhere, and tell me if you notice women being even more than 10% of the people out there. Our culture is built upon keeping women suppressed, and that needs to change.


Honestly, I would ask you to maybe consider the decision of not marrying, ngl, I wanna be the cool uncle, no kids, no partner, traveling the world, cool cars, chill life, maybe if you truly find someone worth marrying along the way, naturally, not through the transactional marriage proposals, then marry him (oe her)"

I think my upbringing played a huge role in my perspective. My parents have always respected each other’s ambitions.

He had to delay his degree because his own father passed away, forcing him to take charge of his family at the unripe age of 16.

Fast forward to today, we have moved cities and even provinces specifically to facilitate my mother’s career, even though my father now earns 4-5x what she does.

Strategy isn't doing everything. Strategy is picking one thing and sticking to it.


This community is an echo chamber.


What's your niyyah? Everything depends on it.


Let's suppose for a moment all the issues you listed do not exist. Then what? 


Concretely, you need to find people who are living the lives you want and then ask them how they are doing it. You will quickly notice that, contrary to what they would have you believe and putting on a macho persona, they have made many compromises.


I have seen mothers who were career oriented but their kids went astray. I have even, personally, seen a mother who was TOO involved in volunteering for religious activities in the community and didn't realize her oldest son was not doing well emotionally, and as a result, her son passed away in his 20s. She told my mom that she regrets her actions.


Did your mother work while raising you? Yes or no, that is sufficient to answer your question and adopt your strategy. If you like yourself, you will need to become like your mother and get a husband like your father. "

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","The element of choice needs to be highlighted in order to be on the solution-end for such problems. A choice will always exist for a man in Pakistan to have a housewife. A choice will always exist for a man that he can have a working woman as a wife.   
  
On the other hand, a woman will always have the choice to have a husband that doesn't care if she's 100% focused on her career. A woman will always have a choice to have a husband that bears all the financial burden. 

In your case, you are being met with proposals that are trying to mend you into something that you are not. Any half-intelligent proposal would respect your career-boundary, and part ways from you, in case they want a housewife. Parting ways quickly, can prevent online rants from both sides.

It's a completely different discussion on how families function if the mother is a career-focused professional; however, you might be able to get some comments from working women in the comment section.

The institution of family is for the sole purpose of comfort for the spouses, and a beautiful protective shield for the children. It's not domestic labor. It's not a grind. It's not a job. It's not a burden. And at the same time, it is. It's something that Allah has framed us into, and we can't escape it once we're in it. 

I personally don't like the fact that the ""good cop"" among the parents: the woman, has to work a 9-5 in order to meet expenditures, or provide for the children. And this is becoming a huge problem for women even in the west. Very few jobs are ""passions"". Most are just worthless grinds that drain the life force out of men, and let alone what women go through.  
  
The capitalistic system thrives on a weakened institution of family. Consumerism peaks when a family fails to be born. A man should chase lust and power. The woman should chase fame and glamor. No place for family here.

In this society, careers emerge out of compulsion, and are shaped due to family, geography, health, mental health, and much more. If you believe that yours is a ""passion"", then understand that the ""bridge"" that you talked about in the last paragraph of your essay, is whatever you make of it. Use it to go.... where you want, or not at all...

Leverage your ""passion"" or ""career"" to get something better for yourself. But maybe try to reevaluate if the definition of family will work for you or not... Because the definition of ""family"" itself is the antithesis of personal pursuits. 

Learning about Allah's philosophy regarding humanity will help reframe our duties, obligations, and the extent of personal pursuits... It might help you take not only better decisions, but make them with a lot of peace and confidence. In the end, it's just the contentment in our choices. Paint your decisions with divine subservience to find that peace, is my advice.

You'll find the right man. He'll change a little bit for you. You'll change a little bit for him. And then both of you may change for your children. That is the definition of family."

However, you have a weird dynamic in your mind where you think that the wife would have to ""beg"" her husband for things if she doesnt have a carrier herself when you compared it with when you ask your father for stuff and he gets you that just out of love. 

I've been raised by a homemaker and almost every elder woman I know in my family is a homemaker, not a career woman. Not even once I've witnessed that kind of dynamic. In fact, the men spend just a fraction of their income on themselves while the majority goes to their family. And wives usually ""demand"" not beg and husbands usually go above and beyond to fulfill those demands and to make their wives happy, while in return, the wives take care or their husbands and children. Isnt that how a normal family supposed to be in a homemaker dynamic lol? How is it ""free labour""? Trust me hiring paid labour to do your housework and look after you is waayyy cheaper than having a wife and maintaining her lifestyle.

Also, I don't think that people are asking you to leave your career because they are ""controlling"". It's often because of the provider and protective mindset of men that why should their wives go out and face the harsh world as well when they are doing it already. You may call it pride or whatever but this is the usual mindset. 

People want different things and you cant blame them for having a preference. They have a right to chose a wife who would be a homemaker and you have a right to choose a husband who doesn't have a problem with you working.

I'd say dont loose hope, finding a compatiple the perfect spouse is never easy. If it were, we'd all be married. Goodluck."

It can also be provided by a father or a brother... And yes men and women are different in terms of strengths and weaknesses, both mentally and physically. Both have different limitations. Otherwise, there would be only one gender. 

Also, the protective instinct of men over the women is quite primitive and natural which is true in all demographics. When something is natural, then common sense says that there would be a perfectly good reason for it.

(148th on GGI for a reason)","Your entire argument rests on a modern, westernized misunderstanding of marriage and gender roles, and then blamed on Pakistan when it clashes with reality.

Marriage is designed around stability, hierarchy, and clearly defined roles. Historically and practically a household works best when one person is the primary provider and the other is the primary caretaker. Men and women does not have identical social obligations, regardless of how uncomfortable that fact makes you.

This term ""financial dependence as control"" is a cop-out and ideological framing that has nothing to do with reality. For centuries women have always depended on men economically because men bear the responsibility of provision, protection, and public struggle. That dependency is the trade off that allows women freedom from the burden of competing, and surviving in a hostile economic system. Do you really want the benefits of traditional protection without the responsibilities that come with it??"

Promoting egalitarianism, which prioritizes social equality and dignity for all, is not a ""Western misunderstanding"" but a proven economic strategy.

Calling protection “coercion” assumes that autonomy is the highest good and that all forms of dependence are inherently degrading. That assumption is the ideological brainwashing I was talking about. Every stable society limits individual autonomy in exchange for order and mutual obligation. Marriage is one such institution. If any reduction of autonomy is framed as oppression, then marriage itself becomes incompatible with adulthood, not just any traditional marriage.

Promoting egalitarianism, which prioritizes social equality and dignity for all, is not a ""Western misunderstanding"" but a proven economic strategy. 

Yes, women have always worked but largely within family based economic units, not as independents pursuing personal advancement detached from household priorities(aka modern feminists). This ideological brainwashing is not women just contributing; it is women insisting that their individual careers must remain untouchable regardless of marital consequences. And bringing Egalitarian systems in the discussion especially concering a culture like Pakistan is illogical excluding externalize costs: lower birth rates, weaker family cohesion, higher divorce, and atomized social structures. Economic output alone is not the only metric of a society’s health.

&gt;I have heard this script before; dismissing a woman's autonomy as a 'cop-out' is just a defensive tactic to avoid admitting that true respect in a relationship requires a foundation of equality.

The disagreement here is not about dignity. It is about whether marriage should prioritize individual autonomy or collective stability. Men like me or the men who have rejected you so far choose the latter, openly and unapologetically. You can reject this model if you want (men are equally free to reject you too) but stop pretending that your rejection is morally self evident rather than value driven."

And in return they are called gold diggers for getting back the bare minimum yes most men dont give their wives a lot or just cannot afford to(in which case they should let the wife earn and help with the household stuff). If men dont not want to provide and want to spend money on themselves they should just stay unmarried its that simple. If i dont want to give money to maids and helpers i would just not hire them. I cannot hire a maid or any helper or anyone and get the benefits frim them and then complain and whine about having to give them a shelter or some money. So make it make sense and do the calculations


And now for the men coming at me,women can have sexual relations without marriage and not even be expected to do anything for those men and they even treat you better(emotionally) than most ungrateful husbands treat their wives(i know that mostly because in those situations the women are able to be more sexual which is why the men also treat them better but thats because they dont have to do the other household responsibilities and manage kids) And generally We do not have to pay or beg for sex.

As an experienced debator with regional as well as national wins, I can assure you I do not need to rely on AI. The quality of the argument stands on its logic, not the tool used. 

Your argument is based on a historical fallacy. Past prosperity was achieved through exploitation and female exclusion, not a successful non-egalitarian model. Modern, sustainable prosprity requires inclusion and human capital.
 
Linking the global fertility decline to a ""failure"" of egalitarianism is misleading. Fertility decline is a complex phenomenon tied to education and economic security for both genders.

The potential of a population is maximized through skilled labor, innovation, and tax revenue. The idea that women's contribution must be defined by childbirth and child-rearing is precisely the patriarchal constraint we are arguing against. The choice to utilize that potential in the workforce or at home belongs to the woman, not to a state demanding demographic quotas.

But this depends on a lot of factors. Plough dominated agriculture was mostly men because of how physically demanding it was (some even say that patriarchy is stronger in those areas). Women would have different work to do (and also housework was genuinely time consuming: making clothing, converting raw ingredients into food, washing clothes manually etc.) and you also needed to produce many children because of child mortality and the usefulness of extra labour. There were undoubtedly adjustments made to accommodate that. 

But what does that have to do with anything? This is an English speaking subreddit on a post about a high earning professional (basically aristocratic in terms of relative wealth, and aristocratic women didn't work). We don't live in that brutal Malthusian world anymore. Not even the illiterate peasants of Pakistan live in that world. And peasant women were completely dependent on their families. The only law enforcement was the patriarch. Their toil was to survive, not for an exit plan. They did ""unpaid labour"".

I see a lot of housewife Pakistani women who feel so miserable/unhappy with life and from that get drawn into petty things that fall into sin (backbiting, judging, gossiping, nosiness, ungratefulness, etc.), which isn't good for the kids or husband or society either.

IMO Human beings tend to show some traits that don’t directly lineup with “continuing to exist” because of this apparent trade-off between encoded communal vs individual well-being. In short, the large brain do help us “propagate” better but it also results in the ability to just rather go for immediate personal well-being.

In my experience though, it wears you down.

It seems you're just going on a rant of man hating. I'm sure there are many men like me who would be ok with their wife taking the role of bread winner, especially if she is earning a lot."

(148th on GGI for a reason)","Im not married. But thats how things turn out to be. Your whole life will be bound to your kids and the house. Like a man can travel without the family even after getting married and can still enjoy life like a bachelor. Can a woman do that? Even if she does,she will be called irresponsible and what not. See i also earn and i worked extremely hard to get to where i am. And i swear to you i will always choose this because in this case scenario if i was a man all i would have to do is earn which i am already doing. If being a housewife was so amazing,why do men want their daughters to be financially independent and independent in every way possible and to have a job?? Because nobody respects housewives its like work that doesn't get appreciated or respected. If it was so amazing,no woman would have had the desire to be independent and not just stay home. Because its hard we know its hard. Men don't"
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",Well more power to you. Why do you have an issue with me trying to choose what I want to do when I'm supporting your decision to work? It's like arguing for the sake of arguing.
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",Thats how almost 90% of marriages are in Pakistan and no they can't leave they dont have the option to leave. Because they're not independent and even if they are independent their parents would not support their decision and not everyone is able to be strong enough as a woman to live in a society all alone where nobody accepts her anymore not even her own family. So its HARD. And you should not wish to become one. Not every man is going to treat you amazingly without making it look like he's doing you a favor by providing for you.

And P.S. maybe that is your experience or expectation from life. That's not how it is in my marriage or my social circle atleast. I guess I am surrounded by the other 10%. Hopefully you can join us. But not before you lose the ""he Vs she"" mentality and make it the ""us"" mentality."

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",Its not a he vs she mentality. I dont hate men. I love men. But i do not like them as husbands. They're great as partners or boyfriends but definitely not husbands(in most cases). I wont have a problem being someone's partner and i wont even ask him to provide for me if we're both equals. And if i only have to earn and have sex (like they do in most cases)

I buy him gifts when i want to,he buys me when he wants to. We dont have to only if we want to so its not like a chore or responsibility(life gets complicated when doing  something for someone becomes a chore. I will have no problem sometimes making food in a that kind fo situation(despite having maids)because my husband will thank me for it and appreciate it it wont look like something i HAVE to do because he's providing for me. And if the two of us can also have our own lives and dont always have to be around each other. But men do not like this idea of marriage so i dont know. :) anything other than this kind of relationship is unfair to one of the partners(mostly women)"
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","I can agree with much of that except the idea of living separate lives. Marriage to me is the decision to share one life, not merely to coexist in parallel.

But congrats to you, two income households are becoming the norm now, not always by choice, but by necessity due to an economy weighted down by debt and rising costs. Yet that isn’t freedom. It can feel like a quieter kind of slavery, earning more just to keep up, trading hours you will never get back for the right to breathe between obligations.

You work longer to afford a life you have less time to live. spending what you make on a shrinking pocket of “free” time."
"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)",Well its not merely about working more or earning just for the sake of earning. I have other goals. And i feel like the traditional marriage will stop me from pursuing them. And i genuinely believe people cannot survive on live together and still have separate lives. But yes it comes down to preferences. Have a great day :)

nice.

"I'm a 23 y/o woman with a high-paying career, and being asked to trade it all for the 'generous' promise of 'food and shelter'. Pakistan, why are we like this? (148th on GGI for a reason)","Listen lady... (behen?)... get out of your bubble and stop confusing your social issues with the deep rooted structural inequalities in Pakistan that actually cause the gender gaps, including gender earnigs gap etc. 

You are an educated, high-earning, remote working baddie... awesome and more power to you. What you are facing are gender norms and social pressures, which, in some ways, are experienced by all people (all genders) to their detriment, and the power to defeat them is entirely with you, and your ability to say no. The lady-medical student who couldnt become a practicing doctor because Baba Jan and Hubby didnt allow it, are to blame themselves. These women need to take responsibility and claim their freedom. Independence isnt comfortable and one has to make hard choices. 

So what causes gender gaps in Pakistan. Lets see... 

In the developed world, there is a brewing boy crisis where boys are falling behind women in education. Pakistan (and similiar countries) are so far behind, that still in Pakistan, women are unable to get an education. That means opportunities for women, are limited. This does not apply to you. 

Then, mobility is a problem. Women start experiencing sexual harrasment when they step out of their homes, on the way to work in public as well as pvt transport, at work.. on the way back... and sadly... even at home. You know better than me of this struggle.  We have failed to mobilize women so they can't participate in the economy. Unsafe public transport... unsafe work environments, lack of professionalism, access to healthcare etc means vulnerable classes, including women, are not able to participate in the economy and move up the social ladder. 

Then there are lack of opportunities. What can an uneducated woman from lower class do in Pakistan, ... Nanny, Cook, maid... ? Why cant they be drivers, traffic police, cashiers at stores... road side vendors, petrol pump staff (exceptions do exist). Our society is not geared to let women function at grass root levels. 

Taken together, this results in a lack of opportunity for women to grow into entrepreneurs, leaders, politicians etc thereby causing all sort of gender gaps. If we improve women economic participation, Pakistan can flourish...

So.. in summary... gender gaps are being caused by significant structural issues... you are part of a small minority of women who have the means to be independent. Dont let hubby... or even mama, baba, nani amma or dada abbu tell you to give that up because ""tum apnay ghar ki hojao gi tu aram aajayega"" or ""grandkids chahyein"". 

All the best"

Also, it’s good to be confident and proud of your career but you also come off as slightly arrogant. Assuming that every man you meet will be earning a fraction of your income is not true. You just need to keep looking. Which brings me to my next point: ask yourself if you will be comfortable with a man who earns lesser than you. Almost every woman I know said that they would not and are not comfortable pitching in more than 50% for household expenses."
